# PyTorch-Deep-Learning-Training-Template

A clean template for training and fine-tuning deep learning models in PyTorch.

### Features
- Simple structure: dataset → model → train → validate
- Fine-tune pretrained ResNet-18 or other torchvision models
- Works for any folder dataset with `train/` and `val/` subfolders
- Reusable modular files (`dataset_loader.py`, `train_utils.py`, etc.)
